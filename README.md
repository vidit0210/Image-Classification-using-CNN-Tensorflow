# Image-Classification-using-CNN-Tensorflow
I have used CIFAR10 dataset to classify images.The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. One has to normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, one can see their predictions on the sample images. link for Data set: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
